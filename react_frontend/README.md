# React demo of the LBDserver Client API
This is a demo project for using the LBDserver (NodeJS) client API (`npm i lbdserver-client-api`) in a ReactJS environment. 

## How to install
1. `git clone https://github.com/LBD-Hackers/lbdserver-api-demo-react`
2. (node -v: 16 => tested with NodeJS 16)
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run start`

## Pages:
There are two pages: one for demonstrating each function, and a very simple semantic enrichment page. You can find the former under /src/pages/Documentation/Dialogs (Page component in the /src/pages/DemoPages/index.js). The enrichment App can be found in as /src/pages/Enrichment/index.js.
